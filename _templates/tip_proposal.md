## TIP Template

This document provides a basic outlined for the proposal and incubation of a TIP under the TSWG.

This template is to be used by the TIP Proposal Process.

### Name
* `xxxxx`
* Repo Name: `xxxxx-tip`
* Reasoning:
<font color='cyan'>This name will be how this profile will be used in the industry. Provide some background context for why the name was chosen.</font>

### Purpose
<font color='cyan'>Describe the concepts behind this TIP proposal and specifically what makes this TIP unique.</font>
<font color='red'>Required for TIP Proposal</font>

### Convener(s)
<font color='cyan'>List the organizers who will work to incubate this TIP through the maturation process. There will often be several.</font>
<font color='red'>Required for TIP Proposal</font>

### Stakeholders
<font color='cyan'>List the interested parties willing to be named in association with this incubation endeavor. Over time, stakeholders will be added/removed. This list should focus on the initial sponsors at the time of the proposal.</font>
<font color='red'>Required for TIP Proposal</font>

### Key Motivators
<font color='cyan'>List the reasons that triggered the proposal.</font>
<font color='red'>Required for TIP Proposal</font>

### Differentiation
<font color='cyan'>List the reasons why this TIP differs from others.</font>
<font color='red'>Required for TIP Proposal</font>

### Core Principles
<font color='cyan'>Technology alone does not make a TIP unique. List here one or more core principles that will help shape the applicability of the profile. Details behind each listed principle will be addressed in the incubation process not here. For simplicity, this section SHOULD reference existing Design Principle recommendations.</font>
<font color='green'>Required for TIP Graduation</font>

### Technical Stack Proposal
<font color='cyan'>Identify the technologies associated with each layer of the ToIP Stack that will help to define this TIP.</font>
<font color='red'>Required for TIP Proposal</font>

### Use cases to be validated
<font color='cyan'>List one or more use cases where this profile may be applicable.</font>
<font color='green'>Required for TIP Graduation</font>

### Solution Architecture
<font color='cyan'>Documentation that clearly communicates the design, architecture, features, and benefits of a TIP to a digital trust ecosystems targeted for adoption. This section MUST include all artictecturhe decision records associated with the various underlying components required to enable a solution. For example, why certain standardized and customized components are used and where some gaps still may exist. It is suggested that [proven templates for architecture decision records](https://github.com/adr/madr/blob/master/template/template.md) are used.</font>

### Market Dynamics
<font color='green'>Required for TIP Graduation</font>

#### Adoption Metrics
<font color='cyan'>Case study references that provide quantifiable evidence of the real market impact.</font>

#### Interoperability Testing
<font color='cyan'> Evidence of community driven certification of test cases and results.</font>   

#### Vendor Support
<font color='cyan'>Vertical integration of the technical stack must be supported by vendors that can demonstrate the interoperability between multiple vendor solutions that support the TIP.</font>

#### Best Practices
<font color='cyan'>Implementation guidance for adoption of a TIP, including how to incorporate policies from the ToIP governance stack. For simplicity, this section SHOULD reference existing ToIP recommendations.</font>
